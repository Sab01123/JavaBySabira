Q5/- What is the difference between the sleep and wait method?

Sleep()
------
If a thread doesnâ€™t want to perform any operation for a particular amount of time, 
then we should go for sleep() method.

Example

public class Time implements Runnable{
	
	@Override
	public void run() {

		for(int i =0; i<5; i++) {
			System.out.println(i);
			try {
				Thread.sleep(1000);
			} catch (InterruptedException e) {
				// TODO Auto-generated catch block
				e.printStackTrace();
			}
		}
	
		
	}

	public static void main(String[] args) {

		Time t = new Time();
		
		Thread t1 = new Thread(t);
		t1.start();
		
		System.out.println("end of main");
		
	}

	

}
           Wait()	                                                    Sleep()
           -----                                                        -------
Wait() method belongs to Object class.                 Sleep() method belongs to Thread class.

Wait() method releases lock during Synchronization.    Sleep() method does not release the lock on object during Synchronization.
Wait() should be called only from Synchronized         There is no need to call sleep() from Synchronized context.
context.
Wait() is not a static method.                         Sleep() is a static method. 
Wait() Has Three Overloaded Methods:                   Sleep() Has Two Overloaded Methods:
wait()
wait(long timeout)                                     sleep(long millis)millis: milliseconds                      
wait(long timeout, int nanos)                          sleep(long millis,int nanos) nanos: Nanoseconds
