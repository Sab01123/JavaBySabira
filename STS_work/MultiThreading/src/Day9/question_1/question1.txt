Q1/ What is the difference between a synchronized method and a synchronized block?

1.A synchronized method provides a lock corresponding to object-level or class-level
 (i.e class level means static method),
 whereas, synchronized block provides a lock on any object depending on the parameter.
 
2.A synchronized method imposes lock on entire functionality of the respective method,
 while the synchronized block is used to lock a lesser number of consecutive statements.

3.Since, the synchronized method provides a lock on current instance otherwise class level,
 therefore, nullPointException cannot be expected.
 on the other hand, if the parameter evaluated as null, then there would be likely
 a nullPointException occured.

4.synchronized block boosts the performance of a respective program as it is intended to 
 use on an only certain part of the program, rather than the entire method.
 Whereas the synchronized method locks the entire functionality even though, some part of
 code has nothing to do with write or update.

5.Since, performance has an indirect relation with waiting time. In other words,
 the synchronized method increases the waiting time, Whereas, synchronized block has advantage 
 over the method as its scope is limited and smaller than the method.
