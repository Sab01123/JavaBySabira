Q2/ What is a ThreadPool, how to create a thread pool of 4 threads, and write down the
difference between the Callable and Runnable interface

Ans)Thread pool is a pool of already created threads ready to do our tasks.
Thread pool framework is also known as executor framework. this concept is introduced in java5.
Thread pool related API comes in the form of java.util.concurrent package.
Without Thread pool, if we have 10 different independent tasks are there then we need to create 10 separate
threads.
But using Thread pool concept ,we create a Thread pool of 5 threads and submit all the 10 tasks to this Thread
pool.
Here a single thread can perform multiple independent tasks. so that performance will be improved.
We can create Thread Pool as follows:
ExecutorService service=Executors.newFixedThreadPool(3);
Here we have created the pool of 3 threads.
After creating the pool we need to submit the tasks to this pool.
service.submit(task); // here task is the object of Runnable.

Difference Between Runnable and Callable:

Runnable                                        Callable
If a thread won't returns anything.     If a Thread returns anything.

only one method public void run().      Only one method public Object call() throws Exception

return type void                        return type is Object

if any exception raise compulsory we    not required to use try-catch
need to handle within try catch.

Belongs to java.lang package            Belongs to java.util.concurrent package
from java 1.0 version                   from java 1.5 version
