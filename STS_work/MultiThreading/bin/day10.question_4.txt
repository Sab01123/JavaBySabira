Q4/ Explain about thread synchronization(inter-thread communication).

Ans)It means two synchronized threads communicate each other.
Whenever we need to suspend a synchronized thread unconditionally then we use wait() method.
Whenever we need to resume a suspended(waiting) thread then we use notify() method.
this is known as thread-synchronization or inter-thread communication.
In the inter-thread communication the thread which require updation it has to call wait() method.
The thread which performing updation it will call notify() method, so that waiting thread will gets the notification
and it continues its execution with those updation.

Example
-------
class MyThread extends Thread{
int num=0;
@Override
public void run() {
synchronized (this) {
System.out.println("child thread performing calculation");
for(int i=0;i<=100;i++){
num=num+i;
}
System.out.println("child thread giving the notification");
this.notify();
}
}
}
class Test{
public static void main(String[] args)throws Exception {
MyThread mt=new MyThread();
mt.start();
//Thread.sleep(5000);
synchronized (mt) { //getting the lock of mt object
System.out.println("main thread calls the wait method");
mt.wait();
System.out.println("main thread got the notification");
System.out.println(mt.num);
}
}
}
