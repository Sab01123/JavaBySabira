Q1) Differentiate between static and non-static variables?

Ans) Static Members					       Non-Static Members
1.Belongs to class 						1.Belong to Object
2.Can be accessed using        			2.Can be accessed using
  ClassName.memberName			 		  objectName.memberName
3.Static variable initializes with 		3.Non-static variable initializes with
  default values at the time of class	  default values at the time of object
  loading.								  creation
4.All objects of a class share a		4.Each object has one local copy of the
  single copy of static variables		  non-static variables

example
package com.masai;
public class Main{
static int x; (static variable)
int y; (non- static variable or instance variable)

public static void main(String[] args){
Main obj1 = new Main();
System.out.println(x);  (we can directly print x)
		Main obj = new Main(); (in order to print y we need first to create object)
		System.out.println(obj.y);
}
}
