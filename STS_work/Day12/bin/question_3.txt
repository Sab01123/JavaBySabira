ans)     Abstract Class                                  Interface

1. An Abstract class can have                   An Interface can have only abstract  methods. Since
abstract and non-abstract                       Java 8, it can have default and static methods also.

                                                An Interface supports multiple inheritance.
2. An Abstract class doesn't

3. An Abstract class can have                   An Interface has only static and final variables.

5. An abstract class can extend
another Java class and implement
multiple Java interfaces.                       An interface can extend another Java interface only.

6. A Java abstract class can have               Members of a Java interface are public by default.
