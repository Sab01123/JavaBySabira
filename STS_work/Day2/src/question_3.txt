Q3) Explain the difference between local and instance variables?

ans)Instance variable:A variable that is created inside the class but outside the method
is known as an instance variable. The instance variable doesn't get memory at compile time. 
It gets memory at runtime when an object or instance is created. That is why it is known as
an instance variable.

Local Variable:A local variable in Java is a variable that's declared within the body of a method. 
Then you can use the variable only within that method. Other methods in the class aren't even aware 
that the variable exists. If we are declaring a local variable then we should initialize it within 
the block before using it.
