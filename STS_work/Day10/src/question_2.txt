Q3) What is the use of ‘this’ and ‘super’ keywords in java ? Explain with an example.

Ans) The super keyword in Java is a reference variable that is used to refer to immediate
parent class object.
Whenever you create the instance of a subclass, an instance of parent class is created
implicitly which is referred by the super reference variable.

Usage of Java super Keyword

1. super can be used to refer to the immediate parent class instance variable.
2. super can be used to invoke the immediate parent class method.
3. super() can be used to invoke immediate parent class constructor.

Example

class Animal{
Animal(){
System.out.println("animal is created");
}
}
class Dog extends Animal{
Dog(){
super();
Day7 and 8: Inheritance, method Overriding, Object class, super keyword, Object downcasting, toString method. 14
System.out.println("dog is created");
}
}
class Main{
public static void main(String args[]){
Dog d=new Dog();
}
}
"this" keyword:
The "this" keyword will represent the current class object.

There are 3 uses of 'this' keyword:

1. To represent the current class object.

2. To differentiate the instance variable and the local variable

3. To call a constructor of a class from the another constructor of the same class.



Example:

Demo.java:
--------------

package com.masai;

public class Demo {

	int x = 10;

	
	void fun1() {
		int x=400;
		System.out.println("inside fun1 of Demo");
		System.out.println(x);//local variable
		System.out.println(this.x); // instance variable
		
		System.out.println(this);//current object on which fun1 is called
		
		
	}
	
	
	public static void main(String[] args) {

		Demo d1= new Demo();
		System.out.println(d1);
		d1.fun1();

	}

}
