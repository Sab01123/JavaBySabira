Q5) Explain Difference between Upper Bounded Wildcards and Lower Bounded 
Wildcards with Example.

Ans)The ? (question mark) symbol represents the wildcard element. 
It means any type. If we write <? extends Number>, it means any child 
class of Number, e.g., Integer, Float, and double. Now we can call 
the method of Number class through any child class object.
We can use a wildcard as a type of a parameter, field, return type, or local variable.
However, it is not allowed to use a wildcard as a type argument for a generic
method invocation, a generic class instance creation, or a supertype.

wildcard is used in three ways:
1. Upper Bounded Wildcards
2. Lower Bounded Wildcards:
3. Unbounded Wildcards:

Upper Bounded Wildcards:
The purpose of upper bounded wildcards is to decrease the restrictions on a variable. 
It restricts the unknown type to be a specific type or a subtype of that type. 
It is used by declaring wildcard character ("?") followed by the extends (in case of, class) 
or implements (in case of, interface) keyword, followed by its upper bound.

Syntax:  List<? extends Number>

Lower Bounded Wildcards:
The purpose of lower bounded wildcards is to restrict the unknown type to be a specific
type or a supertype of that type. It is used by declaring wildcard character ("?") followed
by the super keyword, followed by its lower bound.

Syntax: List<? super Integer>
