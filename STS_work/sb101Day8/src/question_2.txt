Q2) What are the benefits of using Multithreading?

Ans)Following are the benifits of using Multithreading:

Improved throughput. Many concurrent compute operations and I/O requests within a single process.

Simultaneous and fully symmetric use of multiple processors for computation and I/O

Superior application responsiveness. If a request can be launched on its own thread, applications 
do not freeze or show the "hourglass". An entire application will not block, or otherwise wait, 
pending the completion of another request.

Improved server responsiveness. Large or complex requests or slow clients don't block other requests 
for service. The overall throughput of the server is much greater.

Minimized system resource usage. Threads impose minimal impact on system resources. Threads require 
less overhead to create, maintain, and manage than a traditional process.

Program structure simplification. Threads can be used to simplify the structure of complex applications, 
such as server-class and multimedia applications. Simple routines can be written for each activity, 
making complex programs easier to design and code, and more adaptive to a wide variation in user demands.

Better communication. Thread synchronization functions can be used to provide enhanced process-to-process 
communication. In addition, sharing large amounts of data through separate threads of execution within the 
same address space provides extremely high-bandwidth, low-latency communication between separate tasks within 
an application.

Some of application areas to apply multithreading:
To develop multimedia graphics
To develop animations
To develop video games
To develop Web Servers
