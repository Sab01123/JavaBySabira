Q1) What do you mean by Multithreading? Why is it important?

Ans)Multithreading in Java is a process of executing multiple threads simultaneously.
A thread is a lightweight sub-process, the smallest unit of processing. Multiprocessing and multithreading, both are
used to achieve multitasking.
However, we use multithreading than multiprocessing because threads use a shared memory area. They don't
allocate separate memory areas so saves memory, and context-switching between the threads takes less time than
process.

 Multithreading in Java is important due to the following reasons:
1. It doesn't block the user because threads are independent and you can perform multiple operations at the
same time.
2. We can perform many operations together, so it saves time.
3. Threads are independent, so it doesn't affect other threads if an exception occurs in a single thread.
