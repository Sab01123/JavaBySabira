Q3) Differentiate between process and thread.

Ans)Comparison Basis	                                       Process	Thread
Definition	A process is a program under execution     A thread is a lightweight process that can be
i.e an active program.	                               managed independently by a scheduler.
Context switching time	Processes require more time    Threads require less time for context switching
for context switching as they are more heavy.	       as they are lighter than processes.
Memory Sharing	Processes are totally independent      A thread may share some memory
and donâ€™t share memory.	                               with its peer threads.
Communication	Communication between processes        Communication between threads requires less time
requires more time than between threads.	           than between processes .
Blocked	If a process gets blocked, remaining           If a user level thread gets blocked, all
processes can continue execution.	                   of its peer threads also get blocked.
Resource Consumption	Processes require more         Threads generally need less resources than processes.
resources than threads.	
Dependency	Individual processes are independent       Threads are parts of a process and so are dependent.
of each other.	
Data and Code sharing	Processes have independent     A thread shares the data segment, code segment,
data and code segments.	                               files etc. with its peer threads.
Treatment by OS	All the different processes are        All user level peer threads are treated as a
treated separately by the operating system.	           single task by the operating system.
Time for creation	Processes require more time        Threads require less time for creation.
for creation.	
Time for termination Processes require more time       Threads require less time for termination.
