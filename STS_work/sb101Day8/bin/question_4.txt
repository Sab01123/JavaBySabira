Q4) What are the different states of a thread, or what is thread lifecycle?

ans)Following are the stages of the life cycle −

1.New − A new thread begins its life cycle in the new state. It remains in this 
  state until the program starts the thread. It is also referred to as a born thread.

2.Runnable − After a newly born thread is started, the thread becomes runnable. 
  A thread in this state is considered to be executing its task.

3.Waiting − Sometimes, a thread transitions to the waiting state while the thread 
  waits for another thread to perform a task. Thread transitions back to the runnable 
  state only when another thread signals the waiting thread to continue executing.

4.Timed Waiting − A runnable thread can enter the timed waiting state for a specified 
  interval of time. A thread in this state transitions back to the runnable state when 
  that time interval expires or when the event it is waiting for occurs.

5.Terminated (Dead) − A runnable thread enters the terminated state when it completes 
  its task or otherwise terminates
