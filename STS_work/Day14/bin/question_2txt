Q2) What is the difference between ArrayList and Array?

Ans)

              Array:
              
1.Size is fixed, we can not increase or decrease it dynamically.

2.It supports homogenious type of Data/element.

This limitation we can overcome by taking Object class array.


Object[] objs= new Object[3];

objs[0]=new Student();
objs[1]=new Employee();
objs[2]=new Product();


3. array concept is not implemented based on readymade method support.
for each and every requirement we need to write our own logic,.
even for printing the elements from an array we need to write for loop.
In each array object we have only one non-static variable i.e 'length'.

To overcome the above limitation we need to use collection framework.

             ArrayList:

It is the implementation of the List interface.
It is basically a dynamic array (it dynamically increase and decrease in size).
ArrayList class is the best choice if our frequent operation is retrieval based on index.
Duplicate are allowed.
Null insertion is possible (multiple time also)

example:

ArrayList al=new ArrayList();

System.out.println(al);//[]
		

Note: all the collection classes has overriden the toString() method internally. so they will print the elements inside that collection in [] square bracket.
All the collection classes are like a container or bag which holds multiple objects.
