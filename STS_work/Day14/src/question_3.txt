Q3) Explain AutoBoxing and Auto UnBoxing with Examples.

Ans)The automatic conversion of primitive data types into its equivalent Wrapper type is known as boxing and opposite
operation is known as unboxing. This is the new feature of Java5. So java programmer doesn't need to write the
conversion code.
The main advantage of Autoboxing and unboxing is, no need of conversion between primitives and Wrappers manually
so less coding is required.

Example
int x = 10;
//lets convert this primitive to the corresponding wrapper object
Integer i1 = Integer.valueOf(x); // boxing
Integer i2 = x; //autoboxing
or
Integer i3 = 10; //autoboxing
Unboxing:
int x = i3.intValue(); //unboxing
int x = i3; // auto-unboxing
