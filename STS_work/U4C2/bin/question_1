Question no 1
a) Why String is immutable in java and what is the difference between String and String Builder? And Write
some of the methods of String class at least 5 with example.
ans)The String is immutable in Java because of the security, synchronization and concurrency, caching, and class loading
The main difference between string and stringBuilder is that, A String is immutable, while as StringBuilder is mutable.
The string is immutable means that we cannot change the object itself, but we can change the reference to the object.
Some of the methods of String class are:
charAt()	
codePointAt()
substring()	
toCharArray()	
toLowerCase()	
toString()	
toUpperCase()
trim()
compareTo()	
concat()	
equalsIgnoreCase()	

b) What is the difference between equals method and == operator in java? And what will be the output of the
following code snippets and giving proper explanation.
ans) == is a reference comparison, i.e. both objects point to the same memory location. . equals() evaluates to the comparison of values in the objects.

	    String s1 = new String("abc");
		String s2 = new String("abc");
		System.out.println(s1.equals(s2));
		output will be true.
		
     	StringBuilder sb1 = new StringBuilder("abc");
		StringBuilder sb2 = new StringBuilder("abc");
		System.out.println(sb1.equals(sb2));
		output will be false.

		
		String s1 = new String("abc");
		String s2 = new String("abc");
		System.out.println(s1==s2);
		output will be false.
