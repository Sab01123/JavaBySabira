Q2) Why multiple Inheritance is not supported in Java at the class Level?

To reduce the complexity and simplify the language, multiple inheritance is not
supported in java.
Consider a scenario where A, B, and C are three classes. The C class inherits A and B
classes. If A and B classes have the same method and you call it from child class
object, there will be ambiguity to call the method of A or B class.
Since compile-time errors are better than runtime errors, Java renders compile-time
error if you inherit 2 classes. So whether you have same method or different, there will
be compile time error.

Example:

class A{
void msg(){
System.out.println("Hello");
}
}
class B{
void msg(){
System.out.println("Welcome");
}
}
class C extends A,B{//suppose if it were, compilation error
public static void main(String args[]){
C obj=new C();
obj.msg();//Now which msg() method would be invoked?
}
}
