Q1) Explain about the Marker interface?

Ans) An interface that has no member is known as a marker or tagged interface,
for example, Serializable, Cloneable, Remote, etc. They are used to provide some
essential information to the JVM so that JVM may perform some useful operations.
These kind of marker interfaces used to specify certain type of special behaviour of our object.

Example:


//marker interface
public interface Special {
	
}

public  class A implements Special{
	
	
	 void funA() {
		
		System.out.println("inside funA of A");
	}
	

}


public class Demo {
	

	public void fun1(Special special) {
		
		
		System.out.println("special behaivour applied");
		
	}
	
	
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		
		Demo d1= new Demo();
		
		d1.fun1(new A());
		
	}
}
