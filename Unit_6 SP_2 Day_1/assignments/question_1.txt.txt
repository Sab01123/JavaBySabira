Q1/- What are the limitations of EntityManager methods to perform CRUD operations with
DB?

JPA EntityManager is supported by the following set of methods.
1. persist();
2. find()
3. merge();
4. remove();etc

The limitations of EntityManager methods to perform CRUD operations with
DB are as following:

1.Retrieving Entity object based on only ID field(PK field) @Id.

2.Multiple Entity object retrival is not possible (multiple record).

3.Bulk update and bulk delete is also not possible.

4.To access Entity object we can not specify some extra condition.


To overcome the above limitation JPA has provided JPQL (java persistence query language).

The  javax.persistence.Query interface is the mechanism for issuing queries in JPA. The primary 
query language used is the Java Persistence Query Language, or  JPQL.
JPQL is syntactically very similar to SQL, but is object-oriented rather than tableoriented.
